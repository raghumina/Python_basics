# list in python 
# like other programming languages have array python have list
# 
# list are the ordered and mutable collection of the data 
# lets practice the list 

table1 = [1,2,3,45,6,7,8,9]
table1.append(100)  # to add a value in a list at tje -1 position // we can use .append function for that 
print(table1)

table2 = ["messi","neymar"]
# we can also addd values on the specific postion by this method
table2[1] = "Suarez"
print(table2)

# lets try another function 

table3 = [11,22,33,55,66,77,88,99]
table3.insert(3, 44)   # this ,insert function also inserts the values on the defined position 
print(table3)
