# type casting with different different variables 
##a = "Tom "
##b = 22 
##print(a + b)
# this will show a error in it 
# now i will use the type casting 
# type casting is changing one data type to another 

##a = "tom"
##b = str(22)
##print(a + b) 

# now it wil show a output tom22

# lets check another example 
# lets try to make a simple program  with type casting method 

# the idea is to print a number woith type casting 
num1 = 22 
num2 = "22"
print(num1 + int(num2))
