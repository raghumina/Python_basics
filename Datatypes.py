# creating vairables 
# ofcourse with data types :) :) 
# so varaibles with different different data types 
# 1. 
x = 1   # int data type 
y = 2   # int data type 
z = x + y 
print(z)   # well the output will be x + y which is 3 

# other varaible with other data type 
# string 

name  = "Tim"
city = "Texas"
print(name,"lives in",city)  # so the output will be "Tim lives in Texas"

# the third data type will be float 
# will use float with a varaible 

salary = 1000.00
year = "2020"
name = "Tim"
print("The salary of",name,"in year",year,"is",salary)  # well the output will be "The salary of Tim in year 2020 is 1000.0"
