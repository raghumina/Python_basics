# conditional statements in python 
# the are just giving more logical power to the program to check and compare and analyse to give the required output 

# 
# lets write a sample program 
'''
country = str(input("Please enter your country :"))
age = int(input("Please enter your age :"))
if country == "INDIA":
  
    name = input("Please enter your name :")
elif country == "USA":
       
    name = input("Please enter your name :")
else:
    print("Please wait for another list ")       

# lets try another example
'''
# we will just try for a driving test
