# here we use the turtle
# turtle is a package in python
# it perform various tasks related to symbols loops etc lets see 

# import turtle
# #turtle.color('red')  # Gives the desired color to the line
# #turtle.forward(100)  # It shows a line moving forward (the given numerical value is the size of pixals)
# turtle.right(90)  # turns 90 degree right , the values in the left or right bracet are angles 
# turtle.color('green')
# turtle.forward(100)   # the values in forward and backward bracket are the size of ppixals 
# turtle.left(90)
# turtle.color('blue')
# turtle.forward(100)
# turtle.right(90)
# turtle.backward(100)
# turtle.right(90)
# turtle.forward(100)

# the output will be a square 
# another easy way to do it is 
# here range is a keyword
# steps is the name of the varaible 
import turtle
for steps in range(4): # it will decide how many time you want to repeat this function 
    turtle.color('red')
    turtle.forward(100)  # It shows a line moving forward (the given numerical value is the size of pixals)
    turtle.left(90)
