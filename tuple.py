# tuples in python 
# tuples are also collection of data but immutable we can change the data in it 
# we use () in tuples 

tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5)
print(tuple1)


# we can perform typecasting in the tuple 
# for an example 

var = list(tuple1)
print(var)  

# now  i can perform the various functions on the tuples 
# like addition and sunstraction of the values
